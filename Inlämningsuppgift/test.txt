Step 1: Create a function that takes three int paramaters
- int arr[],int,int

Step 2: Check if source and destination are same return 0,
if nothing is reachable from the given source return -1.

Step 3: Create a for-loop to traverse through all the points
reachable from arr[l]. Recursively get the minimum number of jumps
needed to reach arr[h] from these reachable points. Return minimum amount of jumps.

Step 4: Create main function.

Step 5: Declare an array of type int.

Step 6: Declare an int that calculate the size of the array.

Step 7: Call the function and print minimum jumps to reach the end.
